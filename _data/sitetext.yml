      As bitcoiners it is important for us to promote and enable hyperbitcoinisation.
      We are very proud to operate our central ⚡Lightning Network⚡ node in San Salvador, in a secured datacenter on optic-filber with the best possible uptime.
      Of course we typically apply zero fees policy. We believe in the human network effect.
      Having you connect our node would be an honor ❤
